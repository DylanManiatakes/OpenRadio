**Open Radio** is a community-driven project to build the ultimate Swiss Army knife for amateur radio, leveraging the built-in dual-band DMR radio module in the ComJot CJ-1UV Android 14 device. My mission is to provide a fully-featured, cost-free alternative to subscription-based radio control apps, I welcome any and all help since I am not only barely a developer, but I know basically nothing of Android development when Im starting this project. Cheers
